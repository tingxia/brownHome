# brownHome
Set up:
run npm install to get dependencies. No need to track them in git.
run node loader.js to install and populate database. The database will be under /data.

To run server:
run the server by typing "node bin/www" in the brownHome directory. It is served at localhost:3000. You might also need to check out ngrok to mask localhost to a https or http url for testing purpose with api_ai.
